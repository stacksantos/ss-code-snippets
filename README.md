# <i>Stack Santos Code Snippets</i>

### Hey there, and welcome.

<i>I've put together a hodge-podge of code snippets I find useful in whatever situation you may find them.</i>

Feel free to muddle around, <em><b>pick up a few things</b></em>, and <strong>send me a receipt</strong> if you find an easier way to
do the thing.

Oh and... take off your shoes before you come in (probably should have mentioned that first)
